# Hands-On Microservices with TypeScript 3 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Microservices with TypeScript 3 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-microservices-typescript-3-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789616989), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## Sample prerequisites:
For non-dockerized examples (sections 1-3):
* NodeJS 9.10 or higher 
* Typescript (npm i typescript -g)
* Mocha (npm i mocha -g)

For examples on sections 4-5:
* Docker (can use docker for windows/mac)
* Docker-compose 

## Sample code Usage:
* clone the whole repository to disk.

for non-docker examples (sections 1-3):
* go into each service directory that has a package.json file in it, and install dependencies (npm install) there can be up to 4 such service directories in a single video code, but most have only one.
* run gulp in songs & playlist directories
* use run.bat to run the example, or run similar commands on mac cmdline.

for dockerized examples (sections 4-5) build container images 
* use build.bat or run the same commands on mac
* use run.bat to run the example, or run similar commands on mac cmdline.


## About the Video Course
If you want to make effective and scalable applications with microservices, this course will be perfect for you!

Building a real-world solution with the microservice architecture takes more than is initially apparent. It requires reasoning about building blocks, designing easily accessible APIs, knowing how to be secure by design, and building automated testing coverage from day one. This course will guide you through the steps of building an enterprise-grade solution by utilizing one of the most natural technology choices for this type of application: Node.js and Typescript. 

Finally, you'll build the My-Music app where you'll create your own playlist from an existing song library.
